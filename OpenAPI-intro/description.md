# OpenAPI: Introduction and Practical Applications

This course has three half-days with specific purposes:

- Day 1 focuses on the context of OpenAPI, we will mostly discuss why APIs and OpenAPI play such an important role in today's interconnected organizations and economy.

- Day 2 focuses on the details of OpenAPI. We look at the most important concepts of the specification and how that maps into the API design process. We also look at good practices for OpenAPI and how to handle versioning.

- Day 3 focuses in practical aspects of using the specification. We look at tooling to lint OpenAPI against design guidelines, creating documentation based on OpenAPI, how to use OpenAPI to quickly set up mock servers, and how to use OpenAPI for code generation.
